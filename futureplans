Add a scrollable working continous button

When in continous or normal singular mode, make sure it displays te images its taking under the live camera feed. 

for mobile devices, add a button to use the reverse camera

*Make sure the coninous button isnt overloaded, because it constantly sends due to it being so fast, its quicker than the actual already previous loaded message being read out, it should wait until done before loading the next message please*

*Make sure deselecting the continous mode button actually turns it off* - Every 5 seconds except for the first one which should be immediately.

*add a super user friendly, nice counter to the webpage that shows how many pictures have been taken so far. put it just below the buttons to select a voice* - Done

*Add a message to display if no voice has been selected and a user tries to press the single narrate or continous narrate button please* - Done

*added modification ensures that as soon as the "Continuously Narrate" mode is enabled, the first image is processed immediately, and then it waits 5 seconds before processing each subsequent image.* - Done

Make it so it doesn't delete the previous messsages to the webpage, it simply puts new messages on the line below and it has a max of 400px and a scroll bar appears which automatially scrolls down to show eeach message, also add a timestamp to each message please
